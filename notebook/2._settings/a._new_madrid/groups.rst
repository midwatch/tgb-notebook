Raffen Shiv
---------------------------------------

aka raiders...

The Raffen Shiv (the name is a derivation of several colloquial contractions and
pejoratives) are scavengers and sociopaths who prey on the innocent and the
weak in nomad tribes - they are generally found in places beyond the reach of
the law - and the rest of American culture. They are outcasts, renegades, and
betrayers. They steal from, kill, or enslave any whom they can trap. [#f1]_
