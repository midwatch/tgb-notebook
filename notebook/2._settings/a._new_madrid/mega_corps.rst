=======================================
Mega-Corps
=======================================

The mega-corps are loosely patterned after the `Zaibatsu`_ of the Empire of
Japan. There is a closely held, even private, holding company at the top, with
one or more wholly owned banking/finance subsidiaries, and controlling
interests in a complex web of subsidiaries, shell companies, investment funds,
and other assets.

The internal politics of mega-corps resembles a medieval kingdom with the royal
family at the top with a court of executives and advisors while the CEOs and
senior executives of the subsidiaries are the nobility.

As with any feudal kingdom there are constant internal and external power
struggles between various "noble families" to increase their power and prestige
by any means necessary. See `Dick Jones`_  having `Bob Morton`_ assassinated by
`Clarence Boddicker`_ after being upstaged by Bob in front of The "Old Man" during
a board meeting.
