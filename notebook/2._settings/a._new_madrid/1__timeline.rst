Timeline
=======================================

The Crumbles
=======================================

Global warming results in mass migrations both internally and refugees in the
US, Canada, and Europe. Extreme weather, sea level rise, and shifting weather
patterns disrupt global food supplies.

Commercial space flight continues to expand with 1) lower cost to orbit via
reusable rockets, 2) single stage to orbit scam-jet space planes, and 3) the
construction of space elevators in Africa and then South America.

First manned mission to Mars.

Permanent very large space stations like the Crystal Palace [#f1]_ are constructed
at the Lagrange points.

Permanent colonies are established on the moon followed by Mars.


The Collapse
=======================================

The world economy is thrown into complete collapse when asteroid mining ramps up
to the point that there is a steady stream of formerly rare materials flowing
to Earth and Mars from the belt. These materials are used to build mega-stations
in Earth and Mars orbit.

The "center of gravity" of the economy moves from Earth to the mega-stations.

Moon and martian colonies continue to develop and expand.

The United States goes through something like the collapse in the cyberpunk
universe.

Africa is doing "ok" because it's space elevators are the gateway between earth
and orbit and all goods must flow through there. High rider culture develops.

There is a split between the terrestrial and orbital mega-corps with the
orbitals coming out on top; and this could be between divisions with in a
mega-corp. The locus of power shifts permanently from earth to orbit.

The asteroid belt in permanently colonized by building in and on large asteroids
like Ceres. These stations provide the supplies, repairs, shore leave, and other
services required for the prospecting and mining ships operating in the belt.

A revolution in spaceship propulsion, similar to the Epstein Drive in the Expanse,
opens the outer solar system to colonization.


The Apocalypse
=======================================

Something upsets the balance of power between the various orbital powers
resulting in a major war. Earth is bombarded by a whole lot of asteroids during
the conflict resulting in the long winter.

Possible Causes:

* A major dynastic crisis in one of the tier-1 mega-corps
* A terrorist (or edge runner...) act like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand
  that kicked off WW I
* Discovery of a workable FTL drive by a tier-2 or 3 mega-corp
* Discovery of unobtainium on an intersellar [#f3]_ object passing through or near
  the solar system

The bombardment of Earth could be the work of:

* an extremist group for their own ends [#f2]_
* a mega-corp knocking out a strategic target
* "Vault-Tek started it."


The Long Winter
=======================================

A five year "nuclear winter" is caused by all of the dust, smoke, and other
debris released during the bombardment.


The Dark Age
=======================================

The survivors of the apocalypse and the long winter slog through the long
process of rebuilding civilization from the ashes.
