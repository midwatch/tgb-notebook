The core of New Madrid is located along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers
and is dominated by the heavily urbanized Great Lakes and Piedmont Atlantic
megaregions.

To the east is the Northeast megaregions which is effectivly a continious city
running from Washington DC to New York City.

To the west the Front Range megaregion is expanding as the Federal Government
relocates operations, staff, etc from DC to the "federal corridor" along I-70.

The Texas Triangle to the south west is another destination for migrants.

The Gulf Coast and Florida megaregions are shrinking as the residents migrate
north due to sea level rise, extreme weather events, and other issues.
