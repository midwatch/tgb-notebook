**Kibble:**

By far the simplest of the foods you will find in Night City, kibble was
originally designed by Purina Foods for the South American relief effort. It
has a dry and grainy consistency similar to pet food. Kibble provides a full
day's supply of all the essential vitamin and mineral compounds, along with a
minimal amount of complete proteins containing the nine amino acids necessary
in the human diet.

**Single Cell Organic Proteins (SCOP):**

These Single Cell Organic Proteins are tailored to fit into almost any food
niche. It can, and does, look like any other food product. Soya has also been
genetically tailored to fit into any of the thousands of vegetable protein
foods currently available.

**Prepack:**

Prepack are meals that can be microwaved or self-heated for consumption. While
still largely composed of kelp, plankton and soy proteins like Kibble, prepack
is usually flavoured more effectively and often contains real meat or veggies
inside. In case the thought of prepacks makes your mouth water, in the wise
words of lieutenant Lenina Huxley from the Demolition man, just donâ€™t ask where
the meat comes from Choomba.


**Fresh Food:**

Fresh food became scarce as virulent bio plagues and massive burials of the
Collapse ruined almost all the natural ground water in the continental United
States. Fresh foods that are produced and consumed by Americans are now usually
grown in sealed hydroponic gardens to eliminate the chance of contamination.
Most of the fresh food consumed is imported; parts of Europe, Canada, and the
Old Soviet Republics became the new breadbaskets of the world.
