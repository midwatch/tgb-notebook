Global warming and its attendant consequences triggers another
`Migration Period <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period>`_

Continued development of space infrastructure creates space ports, sub-orbital
transports, and the construction of the mass driver on Mount Kilimanjaro
(CP2020).

Permanent habitation of the Lagrange points and the moon is made possible by the
dramatic reduction in cost-to-orbit from the mass drivers, single stage to
orbit space planes, and reusable super heavy lift rockets; it's assumed that
cargo is delivered to Low Earth Orbit(LEO) and then moved to its final
destination using space tugs.

Zero-G manufacturing results in the development and commercial availability of
"miracle" materials (not unlike Andrew Carnegie & the Bessemer process), devices,
orbital solar power, and who knows what else.

Sustainable lunar colonies:

- Dark side telescopes
- Helium-3 mining
- Food
- Water
- Oxygen

Supply consumables and reaction mass to Lagrange point stations from a much
shallower gravity well.

Develop a space capable reactor to power a
`VASIMR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket>`_
rocket engine.

Locus of world finance markets and such move from places like London, New York
City, Silicon Valley, etc to the Lagrange points.

First tentative steps on establishing permanent colonies on Mars.

The build out of space ports, mass drivers and associated infrastructure results
in (portions of) Africa becoming the next great port; the primary gateway through
which all goods flow (ala the Straight of Malacca).

Highrider culture forms; from Earth but not of Earth.

Great power competition for access to space ports; not unlike the Russian's
desire and need for warm water ports. Can't compete for trade without cost
effective access to LEO and beyond. Those who cannot secure such access are
now "space locked" and have to rely on other powers for space trade access.

Assume additional space ports in Central/South America, Pacific, and ?.
Including small islands and even floating platforms for the most desperate.



Age of Space Faring Discovery
=======================================

aka colonizing the solar system

aka The Expanse

`Space elevator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator>`_

The first quadrillion asteroid is captured and mined which completely up ends
existing financial markets, supply chains, and basic assumptions. Assume huge
mining ships capturing asteroids, processing them, and shipping raw materials
via mass drivers. Wild cat asteroid prospectors plant the seeds for the
`Outer Planets Alliance <https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Planets_Alliance>`_

`Epstein Drive <https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Epstein_Drive>`_ developed,
enabling colonization of the outer planets and their moons. Cost and speed of
shipping drops dramatically.

The locus of human development shifts from Earth and into the solar system.

Practical warp drive developed but lacks fuel source.


Age of FTL Discovery
=======================================

Warp drive fuel source discovered which triggers another great power competition
for control of it.

The fur ball results in three or so surviving great powers (eg post WWI); at least one
surprise dark horse.

Earth is devastated by at least one space bombardment (The Expanse) during the fur ball
and is a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

The surviving powers begin to explore and then exploit other star systems.

Travel is at least as dangerous as during the age of exploration. Ships and colonies
go missing/dark all of the time.

A handful of "jackpot" systems are discovered and the great powers begin shifting
their center of gravity from our solar system to these systems.

Interstellar navigation is dangerous and developing reliable navigation charts
is time consuming and very expensive therefore these charts are jealously
guarded. There are equivalents to currents, tides, trade winds, reefs, and lee
shores which all combine to form shipping lanes and choke points. Warp drive
endurance, fuel and maintenance requirements, and other constraints allow for
pirates and cruiser warfare.

The only FTL communication is via mail ships.

There is a communications lag of months or even years across an empire.


Age of FTL Empires
=======================================

Great power competition is now between empires of star systems.

Maintaining access to the frontier or wild space is the major concern; no one
wants to get boxed in.

Assume that there are axis of expansion which are more desirable than others.
