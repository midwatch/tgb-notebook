=======================================
Transportation
=======================================

Traveling long distances isn't easy.

The mega regions are interconnected using subterranean maglev systems that transport
people and cargo:

- Deep underground
- Evacuated tunnels with plasma windows to maintain vacuum at stations
- Individual pods (cargo, private, public, car carrier)
- Pods are passive and propelled by the tracks
- Entire system is run by an automated system with minimal human oversight
- Private pods are reasonable equivalent to private rail cars
- Limited access ports inside a mega-region


Sub-orbital intercontinental transports

Dirigibles:

- Relatively inexpensive
- Slow
- Used for passenger and cargo transport
- May or may not be autonomous




Aerodyne

- is an aircraft powered by ducted jet fans
- closely resembling a flying automobile
- Personal, medivac, transport, and combat applications
- Autonomous cargo hauling in Cyberpunk 2077


Surface Vehicles
=======================================


Road Trains

Fuel
=======================================

CHOOH2
---------------------------------------

- From a GMO high-sugar wheat
- Synthetic alcohol that can be produced in different weights (diesel,
  kerosene, and gasoline)
- Desperate people drink it


Isn't the primary fuel source like in Cyberpunk.

- Naval Research laboratory (NRL)figured out how to synthesize different
  hydrocarbon fuels from sea water
- It can make ethanol (eg bathtub gin)
- There's a catalyst that can break down plastics and we assume that it could
  be used to produce fuel (gasoline, diesel, cooking gas, etc) from trash

The CHOOH2 has to have a significantly better EROEI than NRL method, assume at
least as good as sugar cane (8.3-10.2).

Assume that the wheat and yeast can be created using easily available biotech
equipment and knowledge at home. Could be a simple as farmers growing the feed
stock like old farmers grew hay for their working animals (10% of land for hay
to feed the draft horses). Might be the occasional patent infringement actions
against people growing the wheat off license...


Electric
---------------------------------------

Assume that there is at least an order of magnitude improvement over lithium
polymer batteries, the chemistry uses easily obtainable materials
(eg dual-carbon or equiv), and doesn't suffer from a negative temperature
coefficient.

Electric is the primary solution for all short and medium range surface vehicles
used for intra-mega region travel.

Might have sufficient energy and power density for use in light aircraft
(Cessna 172 or equiv).


Fossil Fuels
---------------------------------------

Assume people have tapped abandoned oil wells and are running crude refineries
to produce fuel.
