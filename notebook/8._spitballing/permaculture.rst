Permaculture
=======================================

Permaculture is, amongst others, an approach to land management that adopts
arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of
design principles derived using whole systems thinking. It uses these
principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, rewilding, and community
resilience. Permaculture originally came from "permanent agriculture", but
was later adjusted to mean "permanent culture", incorporating social aspects as
inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming. The term was coined by Bill
Mollison and David Holmgren in 1978, who formulated the concept in opposition
to Western industrialized methods and in congruence with Indigenous or
traditional knowledge.
