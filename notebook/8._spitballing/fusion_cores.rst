Fusion Cores
=======================================

A Fusion Core is a standardized container of ultracite (aka unobtainium) [a] for
some kind of stimulated fusion reactor (aka cold fussion) that can power a
reasonbly simple, oxygen-independant, and space flight capable device for an
extended period of time [b].

Inital development driven by the very hight cost of supplying fossil fuels to
remote locations under combat conditions [3][4].

Unlike in Fallout, these are not used for weapons or power armor.


**Use Cases:**

- Ground vehicles
- Electrical generators
- Light aircraft
- Large, long-duration drones [c]


**Requirements:**

- Suitable for use in combat vehicles
- Reliable source of supply
- Lower TCO than fossil fuels [3][4][d]
- Easy to use and support in the field (aka sailor proof)
- A spent fusion core can't be too dangerous


**Assume:**

- Multiple cores can be combined in a single application for higher power [e][f]
- Warships will use another kind of non-fossil fuel reactor [g]
- Starts with military applications and expands into the civilian market from there


**Open Questions:**

- What's a reasonable standard power output per core
- How hard are they to make
- How much do they cost
- What happens if/when the supply is cut off
- How long do they last on the shelf
- What are the known issues with them [h][i]


Notes
=======================================

a.  Some kind of crystal matrix created from Helium-3, ???, and has to be manufactured
    in zero-g to get the matrix to form correctly
b.  2 years of continuious operation or so
c.  `Global Hawk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk>`_
d.  Nuclear surface combatants weren't cost effective
e.  See that Australian tank that used 3 V-8 engines
f.  The sentry bot uses 2 fusion cores
g.  Or rely on a oiler that makes a reasonable requivalent of diesel fuel (see NRL)
h.  See how we had to "bake in" those lithium batteries using CW mode before they would work right
i.  Temp constraints
