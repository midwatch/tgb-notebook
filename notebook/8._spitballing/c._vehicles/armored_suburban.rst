=======================================
Armored Suburban
=======================================

High Level Details:

- Cost over $300K (base vehicle and armoring)
- 1/2" steel armor plate
- 3" ballistic glass

Withstood everything up to .50 ball ammunition and a shaped charge on the
windshield.

An Armor Piercing (AP) round from the PKM did find a weak spot in the door armor and penetrate into the cabin;
obviously a "critical hit".

Obviously did not fare well against tank rounds.
