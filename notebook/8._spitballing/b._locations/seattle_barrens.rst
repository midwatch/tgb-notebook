Seattle Barrens
=======================================

The "barrens" are the areas of a city (or metroplex) that have become
crime-ridden, wastelands, or simply abandoned by law-conscious citizens. They
are typically occupied by squatters, ghouls, shadowrunners, and other SINless
populations. In Seattle, the Puyallup Barrens and Redmond Barrens are
well-known places for crime, gangs, and lawlessness.
