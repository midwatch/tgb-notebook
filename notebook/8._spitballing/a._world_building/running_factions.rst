Creating and Running Factions
---------------------------------------

The Keep on the Borderlands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The real feature is this valley with the caves of chaos and the whole idea is
that you get a group of murder hobos together and they head out into the wilds
and they tame the caves of chaos which are becoming a problem for the good
civilized people of the keep; or something like that.

Descriptions of non-combatants in the caves like women, children, etc and what
they do if they get attacked. It seemed weird that these monsters would live
like people.

This used to be a temple, someone's home, tons of people live here. There's
monsters for sure but there are also other creatures that don't seem bothered
by this place.

Talking to the people we encountered:

- That barbarian chieftain lets talk to him; better yet, let's charm him and
  have him tell us what's going on in the dungeon
- Those mongrel people that seem to keep coming out of secret tunnels that
  parallel everywhere else in the dungeon, can we somehow align ourselves with
  them and get access to those tunnels
- There's two groups of dwarfs working for the same litch that had divided
  itself in half and was with war with itself. Different groups of dwarfs were
  organizing the resistance in different parts of the dungeon. We could play
  the different groups against each other
- Various high level wizards back at home base that I would have to make the
  nice with to get access to various high level spells
- The oracle that lived way out in the middle of the wasteland who was there to
  identify our magic items

A style of play that had a richness to it. Both the dungeon crawling and the
wilderness exploration and the adventures we go into back in town.

All of the good stuff is back in the keep, that's were all of the treasure is
and that's were all of the XP is.


How to run factions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You don't need that much to start playing with this idea of factions, the movers and
shakers in a living world.

My goal is create as little work for myself as possible and to give myself enough prompts
so that when the players express interest in something I have enough detail to given them
at that moment as well as enough to work on for the next session.

I don't want to spend a lot of time before they express interest in something but I also
want to know enough to dangle in front of them and hopefully hook them with it.

So I'm looking to start with about 4-6 factions.

For each one I want to know:

- What their deal is. In the loosest sense possible

  - Can I sum them up in a couple of words or a few short sentences.
  - What are their goals, attitudes, and how do they approach things or
    other factions within their environment

- Who are the leaders

  - What are they like. Are they secretive, are they open minded, do they
    like to share their resources or hoard their wealth, etc.

- Who or what is in their roster

  - Agents, minions, foot soldiers, and different monsters
  - Magic items and other resources
  - What kind of influence do they have

- Hook, Quirk, or Trait
- Something for the players to care about

  - Factions don't matter if your players don't care
  - If the player is interested in it they will find a way to get their
    character interested in it

It doesn't take much at all, just a few sentences but it gives you something to
build on later.

Consider the Archanist Cabal from the Weird Wastelands. This is a mysterious
organization that seems to crop up everywhere. Anywhere these is some relic of
the past or some construct that could be dug up and refurbished they seem to be
right behind.

So it begs the questions from the players:

- Who are they
- Where do they come from
- Do they have a store of knowledge some where and is it possible to gain access
  to it
- If they're the ones that can operate, refurbish, and use the technology of the
  past age and somehow advance themselves what are they going to do with that
- How are they going to affect the wasteland with it

It's those kind of questions that players might ask themselves in encounters
with the cabal that you can hint at and offer hooks for; if the players are
interested then you can build on it and if not, you're not out too much work.


How To Keep It Manageable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So they players have bitten the hook and it's time to reel them in and this is the
point where you really need to drill down on the prep. The light touch details from
before are just to get you going when you really need stats.

Create a few sample NPCs, at least one, maybe two.

These are the iconics for that faction. These are strong archetypes with:

- Secrets
- Goals
- Something they want out of the players
- Things to reward the players with

Prevent campaign cruft by keeping only 3-4 factions in rotation at any given
time.

Some factions will just stop the conflict with the player and move into the
background as they pursue other goals and what not.


The Oracle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Faction oracle. A hand full of dice that I roll whenever I feel like it; it's an
interpretive tool to kick start my imagination in directions that I wasn't
expecting and to create something new.

Each dice represent a faction and the faction's movement and activity within the
world. The smaller the dice size, the smaller the faction.

A 1 on a die represents that faction making a significant step towards their
goal.

I use an oracle with a progress clock of 4, 6, or 8 ticks and a 1 on an oracle
die fills in one of those ticks. Which will show up on a rumor table or
background information for the PCs, or it might be an adventure hook because
something grand has happened in the setting.

Matching pairs or any kind indicate that factions have come into contact with
each other. If the dice are physically close it's some kind of alliance and if
they're far apart then it's some kind of conflict. If possible, I will try to
put the PCs in the middle of that conflict just like I would for any faction
that rolled a one.

I provides an easy illusion of a living world with out relying on complex
simulation mechanics. Pick up the dice, roll them, interpret the results and
just re-roll if you don't like the result.

The big benefit of this and thinking of factions in the world is to generate
adventure hooks. Everything you do for your world should be focused on making
interesting moments and decisions for your characters to make.
