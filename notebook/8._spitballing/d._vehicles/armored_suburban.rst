=======================================
Armored Suburban
=======================================

Cost over $300K
1/2" Steel armor plate
3" balistic glass

Withstood everything up to .50 ball ammunition and a shaped charge on the
windshield.

A AP round from the PKM did find a weak spot in the door armor and penetrate
(a critical hit...)

Obviously did not fare well against tank rounds.
