FTL Travel
=======================================


Grist
=======================================

FTL travel via star ship works but there is no known method of FTL radio, all message
traffic must be sent via mail/courier ships.

Travel times are on the same lines as during the age of sail. ie it can take months to years
to send a message and get a response.

Travel times are somewhat unpredictable for "reasons". It makes it somewhat challenging to
coordinate operations across systems due to communication lag and uncertain time tables.

It's expensive and time intensive to create accurate navigational charts and therefore they are
treated as state/corporate secrets.

The physics of FTL travel creates natural choke points like the Strait of Malacca and the
Strait of Hormuz.

Infrastructure like the Panama and Suez canals and fueling stations create other choke points.
Given a little insight your can predict the likely destination of a target (Battle of the River Plate)

Pirates can chart jumps around a known choke point to provide escape routes like the islands and shallows
around the Strait of Malacca where warships can't follow; in this case it's a lack of knowledge not
a shallow draft

The frontier is along the edges of an established hyperlane route

Classic cruiser warfare is a viable tactic again


Engines
---------------------------------------

**Alcubierre Drive:**

- Requires negative energy/mass; eg exotic matter
- 1500 KG of mass equivalent energy

Critically, the study authors show the Alcubierre drive will take substantially less energy if the travelers are seated next to one another, rather than in a straight line â€” like a penny flying face-first, instead of a gliding frisbee.

The flatter the shape of the bubble in the direction of travel, the less energy you need, according to a breakdown of the paper shared on YouTube by Professor and Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies Sabine Hossenfelder.

There is a varient of this that doesn't require negative energy/mass and could, in theory,
have it's energy requirements reduced to a point where the reactor design is within driving
distance of what we can do today

**Hyperdrive aka Quantum Tunneling:**

aka a jump drive

Traveling the distances wouldn't so much be a matter of how much time you would
spend traveling but more how much energy you could apply to the drive

most models tell us that the ship could only remain in that space for only a few
seconds perhaps minutes at a time

Fuel
---------------------------------------

The most energy dense fuel source is via matter/antimatter annihilation and we
can make anti-matter on Earth (CERN) but the cost of producing measurable amounts
is mind bending.

**Battlestar Galactica:**

Tylium is an **extremely rare ore** used as fuel for the Colonial Fleet once it
is refined. Tylium is a metallic ore, and is very rare throughout the known
universe, but essential for fueling both human and Cylon space ships, including
for the purpose of FTL jumps.

In the episode "Dirty Hands", it is shown that the raw Tylium is stored in
massive silos aboard the **fleet's Refinery Ship**

**Star Trek:**

Warp Drive "Fuel Tank", how does it work?

It's not about fuel usage but about what the (for Voyager irreplaceable) warp
coils that generate the warp field can handle for extended periods of time.
In-universe cruise speed means how fast a ship can go before damage to the
drive system occurs.

As for fuel, the warp core is powered by a matter / anti-matter reaction fueled
by deuterium and antideuterium, both of which are hydrogen isotopes. Hydrogen
is the most common element in the universe, and the red bussard collectors on
the warp nacelles are essentially ram scoops which collect it. So, as long as
there is available from which to create the intermix, they're sitting pretty as
far as fuel goes.

The other requirement is dilithium which is used to control the matter /
antimatter reaction. Except for a couple times in TOS when it actually was
fuel.

I vaguely remember the TNG technical manual talking about antimatter generation
on starships but it used more energy than it took and was only to be used in
extreme circumstances.

You remember correctly on that part.

The Bussard collectors are an emergency system, too, according to the Technical
Manual - **ordinarily, deuterium is replenished by a tanker.**

and if I remember right, they have a means of converting collected deuterium
into anti-matter (anti-deuterium) on board, but only in limited quantities.

It converts at a 10:1 ratio, IIRC.

Navigation
---------------------------------------

FTL is limited to straight line travel

Length/duration of jump is limited by:

- Engine endurance before a cool down is required
- Navigation computer limitations
- Known hyperspace lane vs "wild space"
- Recharge FTL drive drive
- EPE of current position. Smaller in best known space and much, much larger in
  "wild space"

A ship can fix it's general location in space by triangulating:

- Pulsars
- Near stars; probably identified using known general location and stellar emission spectrums
- RF emissions from inhabited worlds and outposts where you are close enough; limited by C
- It's possible that there could be time codes encoded into navigation beacons so a ship can
  get bearing and range from them; not unlike TACAN and the "squitter" signal


Open Questions:

- What is the Estimated Probability Error (EPE) for each fix
- Is there a reasonable equivalent to the `Longitude Problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude>`_
- How long must a typical ship rest between jumps


**Star Wars:**

Though space provided an unlimited number of ways to get from one point to another, some
basic rules governed how and where ships traveled.

- Massive objects exert influence on hyperspace and have to be navigated around
- The large objects, like black holes, are detectable and predictable and form
  the general outline of the hyperspace lanes
- A hyperspace lane isn't necessarily the fastest/shortest route between A & B,
  like a highway system they tend to run between established towns and
  settlements; being on a hyperspace lane is a massive leg up for development
  (see railroads and the Interstate system)
- Lanes require constant updating via surveys; a previously usable lane could
  become unusable due to changes over time
- It's better to end up near a inhabited system or outpost if you have a serious
  system failure while underway
- The deep core had routes that could change as rapidly as 30 minutes and the
  empire was the only organization with the secrets to travel there
- Plotting new routes is time intensive and dangerous. Plot a jump from star
  system to star system and roll the dice; it's more art than science
- Use lots of drones to map out a new route. It's slow and expensive because
  you're going to loose a lot of drones

Ships
---------------------------------------

There is a minimum size of ship that can be used for FTL travel.

There is a reasonable efficiency equivalent to the beam/length ratio surface ships
are subject to and there may also be an equivalent to the bulbous bow.

Cruisers are the minimum size of warship that can conduct FTL jumps and operate
independently for significant periods of time. Has the crew, food, water, fuel,
navigation, medical, and ancillary capabilities required for long duration
voyages. Typically travel in pairs or squadrons and have at least one supply
ship in company if operating out of range of supporting bases.

Destroyers require a destroyer tender which has all of the typical support
facilities plus the FTL drive to move them between systems. The destroyers mate
with the tender before executing the jump, obviously a dangerous maneuver under
combat conditions.

Corvettes and frigates are system defense ships (aka coastal defense) and
incapable of long duration missions. Punch above their weight because of
reduced fuel, crew, and stores requirements(see Italian battleships).

Merchant ships are large, at least on the scale of our current container ships,
and not only carry containerized cargo they can transport smaller craft as
well. You can book passage for yourself, your cargo, or your ship.
