Atlas
=======================================

It is estimated that 83% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, up from
64% in 1950. By 2050, 89% of the U.S. population and 68% of the world
population is projected to live in urban areas.

- Urbanization is the process through which cities grow, and higher and higher percentages
  of the polutlation comes to live in the city
- Urbanization refers to the population shift from rural to urban areas

As the US continues to urbanize the population will continue to accumulate in
mega regions depopulating the rural areas; up to the point where they can no longer maintain
the tax base to operate municiple, county, and even state governments in the most extreme cases.

Regions
=======================================

Cascadia
---------------------------------------

Shared with Canada


Northern California
---------------------------------------


Southern California
---------------------------------------


Arizona Sun Corridor
---------------------------------------

Very high temperatures and water shortages. Possible power shortages to run AC.

Could be a major smuggling cooridor if the Northern Mexio territories continue as
they are or get worse over time.


Front Range
---------------------------------------

Federal government operations, museams, et all are moved from DC to the federal corridor
due to sea level rise. If Brazil can move their capital so can we. This would be massivly
disruptive to all kinds of things.


Texas Triangle
---------------------------------------


Gulf Coast
---------------------------------------

Has been hit hard by rising sea levels, decline in fisheries, and fossil fuel
industry.

New Orleans. May or may not be completly flooded.

Shared with Mexico


Florida
---------------------------------------

Average elevation above sealevel (ASL) is 6'.

Miami is already suffering from clear sky flooding, salt water interusion in
aquifiers, and climate gentrfication.

Would expect to see more building collapses like the Champlain Towers as salt
water erodes the limestone and corrodes foundation pilings.


Piedmont Atlantic
---------------------------------------

The appalachia area contains a massive subterranian urban infrastructure.
Protects infrastructure from hurricanes and other disruptive storms.

It's a major manufacturing center and transshipment hub between the Atlantic
ports, Gulf of Mexico, and Great Lakes.

Old mines have been retrofitted as informal communities and tied into the
various tunnel systems; unofficially of course. The worst sections resemble a
40K under-hive.


Great Lakes
---------------------------------------

Holds 84% of North America's surface water and about 21% of the world's surface fresh water.

- `Facts and Figures about the Great Lakes <https://www.epa.gov/greatlakes/facts-and-figures-about-great-lakes>`_

`St. Lawrence Seaway <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_Seaway>`_


Northeast
---------------------------------------

Assume that there would be massive engineering projects to hold back the rising tide
as long as possible. Would probably start similar to the Thames gate and Venice sustems
and grow from there.

- How long could it be kept up?
- What gets protected
- What has to be abondoned

Other major cities will have the same issues and handle them with varing degrees of
success and/or competance.


Special Locations
=======================================

Gulf of Mexico
---------------------------------------

Lots of wierd and interesting communities living on the abandoned oil rigs.

- Aquaculture
- Synthesizing compounds from remianing oil and gas reserves
- Smuggling
- Pirate radio stations or the resonable equivalent


New Venice
---------------------------------------

An area of a city that was abondoned to sea level rise.


Night City
---------------------------------------

Located between Northern and Southern California.


Territories
---------------------------------------

All of the Continetal United States (CONUS) outside of the mega regions.

Basically it's a return to the old west where we had territorial governments
over huge areas of land and very limited federal resources.

Lot's of room for shenanigans like the
`Lincoln County War <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_County_War>`_, range wars,
smuggling, train robberies, hijackings, fueds, etc.

Assume that there are also a modern equivalent company towns built around various
exploitable resources.
