=======================================
The Rubble Pile
=======================================

Era: Post-apocalyptic Earth

Location: A non-flooded section of a mega-city

A collection (3-4) of large high-rise or mega buildings in relativly close
proximity have partially collapsed into a large rubble pile.

Multiple floors above ground remain fully intact and some partially intact above
those.

The underground sections like parking garages, inter-building tunnels, basements
and such are intact, or mostly intact.

Two entrances have been cleared into the pile for access. The entrances are
spread between two buildings and travel between them and any other buildings is
via the underground tunnel networks.

Lookout posts, similar to castle towers, have been cleared high up in the
partially collapsed sections. Makeshift reinforcement/shoring has been used to
prevent further collapse. These posts may be manned with people or remotly
operated cameras and other sensors.

The rubble cleared for the entraces has been piled up to form a type of bailey
and there is a gatehouse/checkpoint controlling access. Each entrace also has
an checkpoint.

One of the buildings, with a direct entrance, has a fully intact multi-story
lobby which has been converted into a market packed with vendor stalls
selling/trading all sorts of goods.

Public access to the bailey(s) and market is permitted during standard hoursand
there is at least one inn providing overnight accomodations.

There are internal checkpoints restricting access to the non-public areas to
residents and guests only.

It would be very difficult to take this location via assult; work most likely
require a prolonged seige.
