A domed city which envelops the Horseshoe Dam northeast of Phoenix, Alpha remains
a mystery. It's a sealed environment, and no one knows any outsiders who have
been in the enclosure. A few people who might have been representatives or
purchasing agents have appeared from time to time, but they've disappeared
before the could be interrogated.

Alpha appeared seemingly overnight (during the Collapse, when  no one was
watching), which indicates that whoever built it has enough money to finance
fast and thorough construction, and also engenders enough loyalty to keep such
a project from the general public.

...

Observers point out that Alpha has been built on the research of previous
self-sustaining colonies, like the Bio 1 experiments. In fact the only thing
that Alpha imports(as near as anyone can tell) is hydroelectric power. The
state of Arizona would have taken exception to Alpha's appropriation of the
Horseshoe Dam, but the Roosevelt Dam and others are adequate to supply power to
Phoenix's diminished population, and there is still some power being
transmitted to the cities from Horseshoe.
