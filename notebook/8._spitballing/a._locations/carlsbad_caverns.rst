aka "The Caves"

A large group of cyber-enhanced people moved to Carlsbad Caverns to escape the
withering New Mexico heat. There they set up their own community, relying on
underground and above-ground farming. During the heat of the day, they are
protected by Carlsbad's constant cool temperatures, so their power consumption
is minimal. Furthermore, the excellent climate control helps them to brew the
best beers and wines in this part of the country (as well as some pretty
incredible designer drugs).

Everyone in The Caves has cyberoptics to allow them to negotiate the caverns
without artificial light. The living areas are carved out of the rock, but have
been done so without regard for the natural beauty of the caverns. The main
cavern itself (as large as the interior of a domed stadium) is a nightmare
cat's cradle of scaffolding, catwalks, ladders, and hammocks.
