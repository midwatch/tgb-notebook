Artificial Intelligence
=======================================

AI Ain't.

Today, AI is mostly a statistical model build using a set of training data and it
can go spectacularly wrong if the training data set is flawed.

AI doesn't actually understand what the books, videos, etc that it recommends contains, it's
just recommending based on what other users you've been clustered with liked.

Then you have things that go wrong with semi-autonomous and autonomous algorithms:

- Flash crashes caused by High Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithms
- CIWS had a penchant for following the target tow cable and engaging the tow aircraft

- `Adversarial attacks: How to trick computer vision <https://hackernoon.com/adversarial-attacks-how-to-trick-computer-vision-7484c4e85dc0>`_

We don't need actual sentient AIs to create a nice mess and bizarre behavior, just some poorly
trained black box algorithms build on faulty training data. Other things, like chat bots,
can be intentionally exploited and/or manipulated (aka adversarial attacks).

Bot nets and troll farms can be rented to push engagement, appearance of wide
interest, fake clout, and so on and so forth. This is already rampant on social
media and creates a huge cloud of uncertainty. Can also be used to manipulate
content creators who are suffering from audience capture, create artificial
influencers.

Troll farms are at least semi-automated and properly executed can get people to
turn out in real life and do silly things.

AI created, and bot net laundered, fake news (local and otherwise).
