Grey Markets
=======================================

In our world, grey markets not only include thing like re-selling used equipment
like Cisco routers and such, but also the legal and/or quasi-legal stuff that
are the unanticipated consequences of technological advancement; 3D printing
war game models, modding games, weaponized consumer drones, syntetic compounds
like "bath salts", etc.

  the street finds its own uses for things

  William Gibson


"the street finds its own uses for things"—has become a widely quoted aphorism
for describing the sometimes unexpected uses to which users can put
technologies (for example, hip-hop DJs' reinvention of the turntable, which
transformed turntables from a medium of playback into one of production).
