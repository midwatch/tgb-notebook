Night Corp
=======================================

What IS `Night Corporation`_? Richard Night's legacy. The foundation stone of
Night City. Its silent, watchful guardian. Night Corp website, Cyberpunk 2077

Rogue AI
=======================================

It appears that there are possibly one or more rouge AIs controlling people in
Night City.

* `Mr. Blue Eyes & Night Corp <https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/n0yvr0/mr_blue_eyes_night_corp/>`_

We recover the `Operation Carpe Noctem`_ shard during the `Full Disclosure`_
side mission for Sandra Dorsett which states that Night Corp testing an AI
CN-07 on test subjects; one of which began displaying acture psychopatic
behavior. This was the desired outcome because the AI was to be installed on
the devices of the actual target. `Entry 37`_ shard indicated that Night Corp
is flying to the moon for unknown purposes

There is also the matter of the "brainwashing" of the Peralez couple by an
unknown party during the `Dream On`_ side mission. Mr. Blue Eyes was watching
from a nearby balcony during the final meeting with jefferson.

It's an open question on how or why `Delamain`_ is allowed to exist within
the black wall.
