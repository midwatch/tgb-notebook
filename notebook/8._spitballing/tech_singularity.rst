Tech Singularity
=======================================

The technological singularity — or simply the singularity — is a hypothetical
point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and
irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.
According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called
intelligence explosion, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter
a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent
generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an "explosion" in
intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively
far surpasses all human intelligence.
