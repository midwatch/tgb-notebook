Informal Communities

aka Favelas, Slums, and Squats

**Favelas**

The first favela, now known as Providência in the center of Rio de Janeiro,
appeared in the late 19th century, built by soldiers who had nowhere to live
following the Canudos War.

Most modern favelas appeared in the 1970s due to rural exodus, when many people
left rural areas of Brazil and moved to cities. Unable to find places to live,
many people found themselves in favelas
