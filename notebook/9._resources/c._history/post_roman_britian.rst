=======================================
Post Roman Britian
=======================================

The Heptarchy is a collective name applied to the seven kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon
England from the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the 5th century until the
8th century consolidation into the four kingdoms of Mercia, Northumbria, Wessex
and East Anglia.

Anglo-Saxon England came to an end at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

This is a great example of a post-apocolyptic society. The Roman army pulled out of
Britian around 383 CE leaving the Romano-British to their own devices. Increasing
sea-born raids lead to the enlistment of Anglo-Saxon mercanaries who eventually rebelled
and suplanted the Romano-British elites.

The Anglo-Saxons eventually created seven major, and sixtenn minor, kingdoms in
the ruins of Roman Britian that were in perpetual competition with each other
and not only the remaining british kingdoms but also the Irish and Picts.
