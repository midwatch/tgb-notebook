“And then of course, I don’t make it up, but I take it and file off the serial
numbers and I turn it up to eleven, and I change the color from red to purple,
and I have a great incident for the books.” - **George R.R. Martin**

----

Sometime in the far future, humanity has used Faster Than Light (FTL) travel to
expand into interstellar space to first colonize and then build large empires
out of numerous solar systems.

As the extra-solar empires develop the Sol system first becomes a backwater and
is eventually forgotten about as the center(s) of human development,
wealth, and society relocates to other solar system(s).

The question is, how did we get from here to there?
