Sometime in the far future, humanity has invented a practical method of Faster Than
Light (FTL) travel and not only expanded into interstellar space we've abandoned our
solar system.

The question is, how did we get from here to there?

Here is my attempt to answer that question while mixing in all of my favorite things
into a somewhat cohesive and consistent universe:

- Age of Navigation/Sail.
- Alien
- Battletech
- Cyberpunk
- Fallout
- Gamma World
- Golden Age of Piracy
- Post-Apocalypse
- Star Trek
- Star Wars
- The Expanse
- Traveller
- Interesting bits and bobs from elsewhere as appropriate
